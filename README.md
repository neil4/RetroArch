# RetroArch Lite

Based on RetroArch 1.2, with updates for compatibility.
RetroArch Lite is a simpler, easier fork of RetroArch with touchscreen improvements.

Android and Win64 binaries are [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QjhAOmM9OOP0JX0Me5I1eEbpbFsSZk9I).

### Notable Updates
* Scoped Settings
  * Certain settings (aspect ratio, etc.) can be scoped to a core, ROM, or directory.
* Overlay Features
  * Dpad and ABXY-diamond areas with choice of input style:
    * Vector
    * Contact area (Android)
  * Lightgun support (use a SNES_x.cfg overlay)
* MAME Titles
  * Optionally translate .zip filenames when browsing
* Android Updates
  * Combined 32/64-bit core lists if both apps are installed
  * Haptic feedback

### Control Notes
* Menu
  * 'Start' deletes a Core, Options file or Shader Preset, and deletes a Remap if "Save..." highlighted.
  * 'L'/'R' sets min/max value; in a few cases, jumps left/right by 10.
  * Quickset a core-specific browser directory in Directory Settings after loading a ROM.
* Touchscreen
  * On most overlays, tapping the screen center toggles the menu.
